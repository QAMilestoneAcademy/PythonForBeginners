# To get input from the user in Python, you can use the intuitively named input function.
# The function prompts the user for input, and returns what they enter as a string (with the contents automatically escaped).

#Take input from user and store it in variable
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(type(name))
print("Hello, " + name)

#Take age from user and convert it into int
age = input("Enter your age: ")
print(type(age))
num_age=int(age)
num_age_4=num_age+4
str_age_4=str(num_age_4)
##You can also convert to float using float(age)

#Print output
y=float("210"*int(input("enter number")))
print(y)
#Print-Hello name ! In 4 years , your age would be num_age+4
